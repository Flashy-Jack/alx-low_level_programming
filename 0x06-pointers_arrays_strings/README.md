### A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is `created with the * operator`.

- File: `_putchar.c` is a function that replaces the standard library function putchar().

- File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes.

- File: `0-strcat.c` is a function that concatenates two strings.

- File: `1-strncat.c` is a function that concatenates two strings that will use at most n bytes from src.

- File: `2-strncpy.c` is a function that copies a string.

- File: `3-strcmp.c` is a function that compares two strings.

- File: `4-rev_array.c` a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

- File: `5-string_toupper.c` is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- File: `6-cap_string.c` is a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- File: `7-leet.c` is a function that encodes a string into 1337.

- File: `100-rot13.c` is a function that encodes a string using rot13.
