## Project Name:0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Project By: Jordan Crossley

## Course: ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

## Objectives:It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.
		

		
## Technologies
		
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		

		
## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C:
		

		
| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |
		
| `0-main.c` | identify the error and fix only one line |
		
| `1-main.c` | correct infinite loop |
		
| `2-largest_number.c` | Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case. |
		
| `3-print_remaining_days.c` |Fix the `print_remaining_days()`function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years. |
