### Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler versions of the same problem. It involves defining a base case to stop the recursive calls and a recursive step that reduces the problem size until the base case is reached.

### File: `_putchar.c` is a file containing the _putchar function.

### File: `main.h` is the header file containing the function prototypes.

### File: `0-puts_recursion.c` is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

### File: `1-print_rev_recursion.c` is a function that prints a string in reverse.

### File: `2-strlen_recursion.c` is a function that returns the length of a string.

### File: `3-factorial.c` is a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

### File: `4-pow_recursion.c` is a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

### File: `5-sqrt_recursion.c` is a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

### File: `6-is_prime_number.c` is a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

### File: `100-is_palindrome.c` is a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

### File: `101-wildcmp.c` is a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. It uses the concept of wildcards.
